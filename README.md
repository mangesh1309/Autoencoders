# Autoencoder Implementations using TensorFlow

This repository contains three implementations of Autoencoders using TensorFlow:

1. `AE_Conventional.ipynb`: Implementation of a conventional autoencoder.
2. `AE_Denoising.ipynb`: Implementation of a denoising autoencoder.
3. `AE_Sparse.ipynb`: Implementation of a sparse autoencoder.

## Overview

Autoencoders are a type of neural network used for unsupervised learning of efficient codings of input data, typically for dimensionality reduction or feature learning. Each notebook contains the implementation of a different variant of autoencoder, each with its own unique characteristics and objectives.

## Usage

Each notebook (`AE_Conventional.ipynb`, `AE_Denoising.ipynb`, `AE_Sparse.ipynb`) contains the implementation of the respective autoencoder model. You can open and run each notebook in a Jupyter environment to explore the implementations and experiment with the models.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- TensorFlow
- Jupyter Notebook
